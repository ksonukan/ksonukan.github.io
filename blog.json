We can become astronauts, teachers, politicians, doctors, and anything else our young, impressionable minds can think of. The world is our oyster, and our biggest struggles are being betrayed by friends in Uno or trying to keep the rest of our classes from seeing the secret stash of gum we have in our schoolbags. Knock knock. College is here. We have grown older. The signs of the world wearing us down are more prevalent. Family compares you to successful friends and relatives around your age. Social media shows your friends and acquaintances flourishing. You feel happy for other people, but you feel like a failure because you aren't as physically fit as your friend Tommy or are not as financially successful as your cousin Brianna. You start to doubt your path, and may push yourself towards a life path that you aren't passionate about to satisfy the background characters in the movie that is your life. Your belief in yourself has faltered. I strive everyday to be 100% authentic to myself. My name is Kevin, and I am many things; I am a Nigerian American, a global trotter, a powerlifter, a dancer, and so much more. I dream of competing in powerlifting competitions, living and traveling in far away lands, connecting with people through dance, getting closer to my cultural roots, and living life to the fullest every day.

  "sub_title": "All about Kevin Born in Lagos, Nigeria and raised between Kansas City, Missouri and Atlanta, Georgia, I have been well accustomed to a wide variety of environments and living circumstances throughout his life. Growing up, I particularly enjoyed learning about different cultures and languages, reading history, studying animals, and dancing. I transformed my hobbies into potential career paths I explored in my academic and extracurricular activities; I sat on the board for my university's pre-law club, picked up featured extra roles in Hollywood movies and tv shows, worked for a former American president in research, and did everything in between. Needless to say, I have always been a renaissance man, and my future career ambitions show that I will continue to work to achieve even more. My current major hobbies are powerlifting, cooking, dancing (freeform and bachata), coding, travelling, and self-improvement.",
